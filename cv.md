# Profile
At the moment, I am finishing my master's degree in a technical specialty, not related to programming. In the last semester of study at the university, with the advent of more free time, I set myself the goal of mastering another specialty - web development. Therefore, at the moment I have no experience in IT, but my priority is to apply my best efforts to acquire practical skills in the shortest possible time. My strengths are the ability to achieve the set goals, responsibility, the desire to understand the essence of the issue.

# Skills

while n != 0:
    n = int(input())
    if n >= m1:
        m2 = m1
        m1 = n
    if m2 < n < m1:
        m2 = n
print(m2)
